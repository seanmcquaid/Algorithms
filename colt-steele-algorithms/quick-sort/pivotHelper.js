// might be called partition or pivot

// given an array, this helper function should designate an element as the pivot
// it should then rearrange elements in the array so that the values less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot and all values greater than
// are moved to right of the pivot
// the order on either side doesn't matter
// the helper should do this IN PLACe and should not create a new array
// when complete, the helper should return the index of the pivot
