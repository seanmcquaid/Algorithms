# Sean's Algorithm Practice

## Description
Welcome to my Algorithm repository. One of the things that has always intimidated me about technical interviews was whiteboarding and having to solve algorithms. So I decided to take it upon myself and practice this skill as often as possible! I have found algorithms from a ton of different sources and try to alternate languages as to keep my skills sharp.

## Current Project
I am currently trying to work through HackerRank's Interview Preparation Kit. Some of these algorithms are REALLY tough so I have been enjoying the challenge!
