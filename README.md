# Sean's Algorithm Practice

## Description
Welcome to my Algorithm repository. One of the things that has always intimidated me about technical interviews was whiteboarding and having to solve algorithms. So I decided to take it upon myself and practice this skill as often as possible! I have found algorithms from a ton of different sources and try to alternate languages as to keep my skills sharp.

## Current Project
I am currently working on Colt Steele's Algorithms and Data Structures class from Udemy in order to gain more of an understanding of basic computer science concepts that we didn't get to cover in my bootcamp! It's been really enjoyable thus far and helpful in terms of coming up with a set of steps that I can use to tackle problem solving on the spot!
