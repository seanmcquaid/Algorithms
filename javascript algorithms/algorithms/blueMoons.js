// The moon goes through phases because it orbits the earth and the sun hits it 
// differently at different places in its orbit. This means that, depending on 
// where it is in its orbit, you might see a full moon, right quarter moon, or even "no" moon (new moon) at all. 
// It takes 27.3 days for the moon to orbit the Earth, but the actual phase difference 
// from one full moon to the next is 29.5 days because the earth cruises a cool 45 million miles around the sun
// in that 27.3 days. It takes 2.2 days for the the moon to make up for that distance
// and get all the way back to where you last saw a full moon.

// Whenever the moon is full twice in one month, the second one is called a "blue moon." 
// This last happened in July of 2015 on the 1st and 31st. The next time is January of 2018 (same days). 
// You can research the timing, otherwise you can assume midnight. 
// Write a program that determines how many "blue moons" there will be in third milenia (2000-2999)?

// If you want to be really, really specific, the lunar month varies depending
// on the shape of the sun and moons orbit. The average is  29 days, 12 hours, and 44 minutes.
